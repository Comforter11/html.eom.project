                <h4>My Story.</h4>
    My son is my inspiration as I my number one model,<br>
    he is also the man behind the name "Prince M" and I am Comforter M<br>
    Prince M Photography is a baby, born in 2020, only as a part time job,<br>
    but because of the zeal in me I had to give this baby more attention.<br>
    In this doing, I fell deeper inlove with photography and I’ve been living my <br>
    dream being a full time photographer ever since,<br>
    helping families keep memories for generations to come is my pleasure.<br>
    I would describe my style as vibrant, timeless & heartfelt.<br>
    <br>
    I'm more focused on maternity, newborn, cake smashes and fashion. I also have a great passion for family photography! <br>
    <br>
    I’m very fond of kids and I love reading books too. I have three brothers who are still in school.<br>
    My mom is a sales-lady in a salon. I got married on the 5th of May 2019 to Steven M, my best friend and soul mate.<br>
    I am a big believer in Christ and how He’s provided for me, and keeps providing continuously.<br>
    I enjoy being outside on sunny days, spending time with the people that matter most to me<br>
    but I love the rainy days yet prefer cold ones.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you for stopping by, hoping to hear from you soon!<br>
